# Obesity-Data-Visualization

Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive exploration of obesity rates correlated with various demographic and lifestyle factors using Tableau. The aim was to identify significant patterns and trends that impact public health policies and awareness.

Key Components of the Project
- Data Exploration and Visualization in Tableau:
Developed multiple data visualizations to explore relationships between obesity and factors such as smoking, physical activity, and dietary habits.
Created scatter plots comparing obesity rates with other health metrics like diabetes rates, and lifestyle choices.
Employed clustering to segment data into meaningful groups for deeper analysis. Clusters were used to identify demographic patterns in obesity rates among different populations.

- Trend Analysis and Clustering:
Analyzed trends within the data using Tableau's built-in trend lines to understand the direction and strength of relationships.
Implemented clustering within Tableau to differentiate groups based on their obesity rates and associated factors such as fruit and vegetable intake, exercise habits, and smoking status.

- Interactive Dashboards and Maps:
Designed an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter and explore obesity rates across different states and counties.
Integrated geographical visualizations to highlight regional variations and trends in obesity across the United States.

- Insights and Reporting:
Compiled findings into a comprehensive report, detailing the statistical analysis and visual insights gained from the Tableau visualizations.
The report includes detailed charts, graphs, and maps that summarize the correlations between obesity and other variables.
